# Chess-Project
just some stuff for the chess CpE lab final project.
For Alex: So far I've finished up all the logic for Pawns, Knights, and Rooks, including both which moves they are generally allowed to make along with if there is a piece in the way of their movement
I have not yet implemented or accounted for the check system yet, which limits the allowed movements to force the player to attempt to protect their king
ive also included the vga files from the vga lab which I can alter to suit our project
